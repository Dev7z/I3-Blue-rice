the original [version]https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes made by adi1090x had a few things that i didnt like, this is the version that i edited for myself

to get this follow the install instructions [here]https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes

then put this in your i3 conf: exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh --shapes

inside ~/.config/polybar/shapes replace all the files in there with [these](https://github.com/Dev7z/I3-Blue-rice/tree/main/polybar) except this readme of course
